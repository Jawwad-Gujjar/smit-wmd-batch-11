<h1>Hollywood’s actors are back to work—here’s what they actually got in SAG-AFTRA’s new contract</h1>
<p>On Nov. 8, after 118 days of striking, Hollywood actors reached a tentative agreement with studios and streamers regarding the working conditions of their industry. The news comes more than a month after entertainment writers reached a deal with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers themselves.

    Every three years, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists renegotiates actors’ contracts — including factors like wage minimums and safety on set — opposite the AMPTP, which represents studios like Sony and streamers like Amazon.</p>
